gazebo_ros_api_plugin.cpp:
Modified gazebo api plugin. The plugin, at least 
in the state I found it, didn't look like it had
a fully finished GazeboRosApiPlugin::applyBodyWrench.
Update makes slight modification to make xen_quad
work, but should eventually be merged into
the official ros/gazebo plugin api, or an updated
and more functional version of that plugin should
be found. It goes in 
ROS STACK DIRECTORY/simulator_gazebo/gazebo/src/gazebo_ros_api_plugin.cpp
